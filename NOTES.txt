 - when adding new java and xml files, use template/template.java and 
   template/template.xml, respectively, to build file headers
   
 - run:  
     svn propset svn:keywords "Date Author Id Rev HeadURL" file.foo
   on every added file so that the header content is updated during 
   svn check-ins/check-outs

 - try to keep lines shorter than 75 characters

<h1>Data Attachments</h1>
<div style="width:90%"/>
<p>Curation records can be annotated with one or more arbitrary data items (attachments). 
The attachements may correspond to the self-curated interaction records provided by 
the publication authors but they can also contain information about identifiers of the 
molecules mentioned in the publication, suplementary experimental results or any other 
information that might useful during curation process. Besides only accepting text files
(comma/tab-separated tables, xml, plain text files are all fine) Icentral does not 
impose any restrictions on the format or contents of the attachments. Therefore 
attachments can be used to exchange data in a database-neutral manner.
 
<p>The attachments can be created only by the record owner (submitter) and by the users
with the curator role assigned. They are <b><em>not accessible</em></b> to the general public 
and non-curator users.  Therefore, attachments can be used to provide curators with access 
to pre-publication data.

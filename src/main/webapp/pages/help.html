<h3>Attachments</h3>

to the publication record by attaching to it one or more data attachments. The attachments

can be used to exchange, in a database-neutral manner, data files corresponding to 
partially curated interaction records, information about identifiers of the 
molecules mentioned in the publication or any other supplementary information that
useful during curation process. The attachments can be also used by the original 
publication authors to provide access to the supplementary experimental data 
or the initial, self-curated interaction records.

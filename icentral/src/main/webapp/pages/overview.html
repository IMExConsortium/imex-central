<div>The ImexCentral site tracks the status of research articles reporting molecular 
interactions as they progress through the IMEx Consortium curation pipeline.
The pipeline is composed of four stages:

<ul>
 <li><b>Pre-Queue.</b>  Potential curation targets, with exception of pre-publication data
  that is submitted directly to one of the IMEx databases, enter the pipeline at this
  stage. These might include: (a) publications that are automatically identified by either
  scanning of the incoming PubMed records or some other computational methods, (b) publications 
  targeted by IMEx curators, (c) publications requested by curators of the collaborating
  databases, (d) publications requested by the IMEx database users at large. The targets 
  identified by (a) and (b) are entered directly. Targets identified by (c) and (d) are 
  typically submitted by adding them to the Zotero IMEx Curation Request library. 
 </li>
 <li><b>Queue.</b> ImexCentral curation queue lists publications that advanced past the semi automatic
  triage and thus are likely to describe experiments documenting molecular interactions. 
 </li>
 <li><b>Curation.</b> Publications advance to the Curation stage once selected for curation by one of 
  the IMEx curators. Their status reflects curation progress as reported by the curating database.
 </li>
 <li><b>Release.</b>  Fully curated publications that have been released by the curating database.
 </li>
</ul>

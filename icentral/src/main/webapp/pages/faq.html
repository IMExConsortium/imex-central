   <b>Do I have to register to request curation of a publication I am interested in ? </b>
   <p>Yes, as a person interested in curation of a particular publication you might be, apart from
   the publication authors, one of the people most knowledgable about the paper contents and its 
   relevance.  This might be valuable during curation by one of the IMEx curators. It will also 
   let us notify you once the publication has been curated.  Last but not least, it limits the
   possibility of flooding the site with script-generated, bogus curation requests.</p>

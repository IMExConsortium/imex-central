<h1>Imex Central Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<div style="width:80em">
<ol>
 <li>
   <b>Do I have to register to check the status of a publication I am interested in ?</b>  
   <p> No, the curation status of individual publications within Imex Central is publically 
   available to anyone.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <b>Do I have to register to request curation of a publication I am interested in ? </b>
   <p>Yes, as a person interested in curation of a particular publication you might be, apart from
   the publication authors, one of the people most knowledgable about the paper contents and its 
   relevance.  This might be valuable during curation by one of the IMEx curators. It will also 
   let us notify you once the publication has been curated.  Last but not least, it limits the
   possibility of flooding the site with script-generated, bogus curation requests.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
   <b>How do I provide cross-references to the IMEx records on my own Web page ? </b>
   <p>Cross-references to IMEx datasets and individual IMEx records that describe interactions 
   reported in individual publications curated by one of the 
      <a href ="http://www.imexconsortium.org/">IMEx partners</a>
   can be created through hyperlinks referring to

   <pre>   https://imexcentral.org/icentral/imex/rec/&lt;<i>imex-accession</i>&gt;</pre>

   where &lt;<i>imex-accession</i>&gt; is the accession of IMEx interaction dataset (of the form
   <i>IM-nnnnn</i>) or IMEx record (of the form <i>IM-nnnnn-nn</i>). Clicking on such hyperlink 
   will automatically redirect the browser to a page located on the server of the IMEx partner 
   database that curated and/or currently distibutes the dataset of interest. The address of such
    page can
   be also retrieved without automatic redirection by using
   <i>mode=url</i> parameter:

   <pre>   https://imexcentral.org/icentral/imex/rec/&lt;<i>imex-accession</i>&gt;?mode=url</pre>

   Accessions of the publicly IMEx datasets that describe interactions extracted from a particular 
   publication can be obtained through a mapping service located at:

   <pre>   https://imexcentral.org/icentral/imex/map?acc=&lt;<i>accession</i>&gt;</pre>

   where  &lt;<i>accession</i>&gt; is either Pubmed identifier (default) or 
   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">DOI</a> of the article 
   of interest (when optional <i>ns=doi</i> is also used). Provided such accession exists, the service 
   will return a JSON-formatted string with IMEx dataset accession (<i>IM-nnnnn</i>) and information 
   abouth the database that originally curated the interaction dataset.

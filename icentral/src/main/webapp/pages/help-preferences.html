the records that the user commented on or provided data attachments. If desired, the  
auto-addition options can be turned off. Individual records can be taken off (or added to)

<br/><br/>
These control which Imex Central events will trigger sending email notifications. 
By default, notifications are <strong><em>not sent</em></strong>.  However, interested users may turn on 
the global email notification switch and then choose one, or more, notification 
categories.  For example, users interested in the status updates of the records 
they watch may want to turn on the <em>Watched record updates</em> flag whereas users interested in 
receiving Imex Central announcement may want to toggle the <em>News announcements</em> flag.

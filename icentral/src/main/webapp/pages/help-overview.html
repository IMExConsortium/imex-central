<div  style="max-width: 1080px;">
<p>The ImexCentral site tracks the status of research articles, which report molecular 
interactions, as they progress through the IMEx Consortium curation pipeline.
<p>The pipeline is composed of four stages:
</br>

<div style="display: flex; float: left;">
 <div style="max-width: 540px;">
  <ul>
   <li><b>Pre-Queue.</b>  Potential curation targets, with exception of pre-publication data
    that is submitted directly to one of the IMEx databases, enter the pipeline at this
    stage. These might include: (a) publications that are automatically identified by either
    scanning of the incoming PubMed records or some other computational methods, (b) publications 
    targeted by IMEx curators, (c) publications requested by curators of the collaborating
    databases, (d) publications requested by the IMEx database users at large. The targets 
    identified by (a) and (b) are entered directly. Targets identified by (c) and (d) are 
    typically submitted by adding them to the Zotero IMEx Curation Request library. 
   </li>
   <li><b>Queue.</b> ImexCentral curation queue lists publications that advanced past the semi automatic
    triage and thus are likely to describe experiments documenting molecular interactions. 
   </li>
   <li><b>Curation.</b> Publications advance to the Curation stage once selected for curation by one of 
    the IMEx curators. Their status reflects curation progress as reported by the curating database.
   </li>
   <li><b>Release.</b>  Fully curated publications that have been released by the curating database.
   </li>
  </ul>

  <p>The status follows publications as they advance within each stage of the curation pipeline:

  <ul>
   <li><b>New.</b> (Pre-Queue, Queue). A record newly created by one of the data mining programs 
    or IMEx curator.
   </li>   
   <li><b>Request.</b> (Pre-Queue, Queue). Curation request submitted by a third party - non-IMEx curator, 
    curation focus group member or database user.
   </li>   
   <li><b>Discarded.</b> (Pre-Queue, Queue, Curation, Release). Publication discarded due
    to lack of interaction. 
   </li>   
   <li><b>Reserved.</b> (Queue). Publication reserved for curation by one of the IMEx databases. 
   </li>   
   <li><b>InProgress.</b> (Queue). Partially curated publication.
   </li>   
   <li><b>Processed.</b> (Queue). Fully curatied publication.
   </li>   
   <li><b>OnHold.</b> (Queue). Publication waiting for additional, author-supplied information 
    or creation of necessary molecule or CV term accessiond.
   </li>   
   <li><b>Incomplete.</b> (Queue). Publications describing molecular interactions but missing 
     description sufficient enough to create a valid IMEx interaction record.  
   </li>   
   <li><b>Released.</b> (Release). Publications released by one of the IMEx databases. 
   </li>   
   <li><b>Retracted.</b> (Release). Publications retracted by the authors and/or journal.
   </li>   
  </ul>
